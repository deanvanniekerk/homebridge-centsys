# Release steps

1. Update the version in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
2. Add the release notes to `CHANGELOG.md` under the same version.
3. Run:

   ```sh
   npm run check
   npm pack --dry-run
   ```

4. Commit the changes, open a pull request and merge it into `main`.
5. In GitHub, open **Actions → Publish npm release → Run workflow**, select
   `main`, enter the exact version and approve the `npm` environment.

The workflow publishes to npm and creates the Git tag and GitHub release. Do not
create those manually.
